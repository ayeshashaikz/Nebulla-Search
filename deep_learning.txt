Deep Learning is a specialized area of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.
These deep neural networks can automatically learn hierarchical features from large datasets.
Deep learning is widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
Popular deep learning models include convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.
High computational power and large amounts of data are required for effective deep learning systems.
