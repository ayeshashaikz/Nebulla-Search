Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment.
The agent takes actions, receives rewards or penalties, and updates its behavior to maximize cumulative reward.
Reinforcement learning is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.
Unlike supervised learning, reinforcement learning does not require labeled data.
It focuses on learning optimal strategies through trial and error.
