Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Machine learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships in data to make predictions or decisions.
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
ML is widely used in applications such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, recommendation systems, and speech recognition.
