Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
These tasks include reasoning, problem solving, perception, learning, and decision making.
AI systems can be rule based or data driven.
Common applications of artificial intelligence include virtual assistants, recommendation systems, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles.
Modern AI combines algorithms, data, and computing power to simulate intelligent behavior.
